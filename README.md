# Festival Landing Page

It is one of my first projects for client-side development. 

At first I have built same page with vanila js / css without any frameworks.

This allowed me to understand better the fundamentals of HTML/CSS and Javascript.

Lastly, I have rebuilt it with Bootstrap 4 framework.
This repo contains only final version of Festival project.


## Getting Started

As this project is pure client-side website, there isn't much to do, you just need to clone project and open index.html
or upload to some hosting and it will work.
